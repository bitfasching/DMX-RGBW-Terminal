Control RGBW lights via DMX using your serial terminal. Requires an Arduino with a second hardware serial port, see [LeoDMX](https://github.com/bitfasching/leodmx). Set value for red, green, blue and white by typing the first letter R, G, B or W, respectively, followed by an integer number between 0 and 255 as parsable by [parseInt()](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/parseInt).
